                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <h3> NCAA 14 was the last iteraiton of its kind. Back in 2013 when the Ed O' Bannon case was taking place, the NCAA ruled it illegal for anymore NCAA Sports games to be made. Making this game the last of its kind. NCAA 14 featured over 126 FBS Division 1 football teams with their team logos, school traditions,  and even real life stadiums. At the time of the ruling this was devastating news because college games were slowly dying out and this was the last of them.  Another College football game wouldn't be announced for another 8 years. This game was available on PS3 and Xbox 360 at the time of its release. </h3>

The success only propelled from there , the mod only gained more attention from the creators of the orignal game, EA Sports. Not too far later after the ruling that allowed college athletes to make money off their name and likeness. A new CFB game was announced for September 2023. </h3>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <h3> Madden is the only football simulator on the market. It's a NFL licensed game with over 32 NFL teams with real players and likeknesses. Throughout the years Madden has had a rough history when it comes to game reviews. The game has been plauged with constant monetary greed and bugs that the football community finds abysmal. Being it's on the only NFL licensed game on the market due to EA buying the license through 2025 they have 0 competition to stop these issues. This year has reached a new low for the franchise and the future looks awfully bleak for the game. </h3>
                    <h2>News</h2>
                    <h3>Remember when I said the Madden community finds the game abysmal? Well as of November 2021 the average user score for Madden 22 out of 10 is..... 0.6! This is easily one of the most hated Madden games of all time considering how well loved madden was a decade ago and on last generation of consoles. It's a shame the fall from grace the series has taken. It also ironically was rated a 6/10 on IGN this past year. The game is currently live on Xbox One , PS4 , Xbox series X , PS5 and PC.   </h3>
