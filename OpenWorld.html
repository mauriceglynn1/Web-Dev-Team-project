                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <h3>In video games, an open world is a game mechanic of using a virtual world that the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear and structured gameplay.</h3>
                    <h2>News</h2>
                    <h3>The roots of open-world gaming can be traced back as early as Go (c. 300 BCE). The first open-world game was SEGA's Jet Rocket (1970), followed by Taito's Western Gun (1975) and Interceptor (1975). The first 3D open-world game was SEGA's combat flight simulator Heli-Shooter (1977).</h3>

<p> <center> <font color = "white"> No Man's Sky is a survival game developed and published by Hello Games. It was released worldwide for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in August 2016, for Xbox One in July 2018, and for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S consoles in November 2020. The game is built around four pillars: exploration, survival, combat, and trading. Players are free to perform within the entirety of a procedurally generated deterministic open world universe, which includes over 18 quintillion planets. Through the game's procedural generation system, planets have their own ecosystems with unique forms of flora and fauna, and various alien species may engage the player in combat or trade within planetary systems. Players advance in the game by mining for resources to power and improve their equipment, buying and selling resources using credits earned by documenting flora and fauna, building planetary bases and expanding space fleets, or otherwise following the game's overarching plot by seeking out the mystery around the Atlas, an entity at the center of the galaxy.</center>
