<p> <center> <font color = "white">The 2018 Spiderman follows our favorite Spiderman swinging through New York. Web-swinging swinging, dashing, wall running, flips and tricks on the ground and in the air is glorious. There's nothing quite like it in modern video games. In many ways it's the high-definition sequel to 2004's Spider-Man 2 and shares many of the same systems. Even though an old game it still comes out on top as we all love a good game that allows us to be our favorite superheroes. As any game the story mode allows you to play Peter Parker and Spiderman there are challenges where Peter is need and challenges where Spiderman is needed. This is an open world filled with stuff to do making you stronger and more skilled. We also canâ€™t forget about the cool costumes you find on the way that also give you special powers, as well as level up. The only thing I can complain about is the length of the game. I do wish it was longer right now the game having on 15-20 hours does not really allow you to have a good long time to play as the web slinger.</center>

<p> <center> <font color = "white"> The sqeual to the 2018 Marvel Spiderman follows our boy Miles who is learning to how to use his new Spider powers and save the city while Peter Parker is on Vacation just like the first game you play as Miles and Miles version of Spiderman unlocking new skills, suits, task, and fighting styles. This game gives you all the powers of Spiderman plus Miles extra twist from camouflage to Venome blast. This open world game is a great oppturnrity to play everyone favorite web slinger with a gameplay of more than 15 hours. Not to exciting for Spiderman lovers but a great fighting game for those who love playing superheros!

<p> <center> <font color = "white"> First off, the game itself is very historical and has GREAT role modles, I love ninjas and samurai with this game your put in the shoes of a samurai, and the whole point of the game is to stop your enemy The Samurai way from taking over a place called Tsushima. The game is action pack with old century weapons swords, bows, spears and axes its relatistic with blood jumping on and over buildings. Ghost Of Tsushima play time is short with 24-26 hours of long if you focus only on the Main Mission and if you include few side activities that unlock new weapons or armors.
